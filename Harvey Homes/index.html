<div class="Content">
	<p> Harvey Homes of Distinction Ltd was established in the year 2000 by Mr John Harvey M.C.I.O.B. </p>

<p>John has 25 years of experience at management and senior management level in all aspects of the building industry and is a past chairman of the Chartered Institute of Builders for the North Wales & Chester branch.</p>

<p>The multi award winning company also possesses the coveted Investors in People award and prides itself in continually re-training and updating staff with current ideas and building regulations.</p>

<p>However, the Companyâ€™s greatest pride is in the outstanding quality of the bespoke homes that they construct and the quality of the after care service. Their testimony to this is the fact that Harvey Homes keep in touch with many of their clients. Some go on to buy more homes from the company and many are more than happy to be contacted by potential purchasers to give high recommendations of their experience of dealing with the company.</p>

<p>All our homes are built with a 10 year NHBC guarantee and either Mr John Harvey or Mrs Joanne Harvey (Sales) are only too happy to meet with potential purchasers to show you detailed photographs of previously constructed homes (so that you can see the quality of our finishes) and to discuss current sites.</p>

<p>We also offer a contracting service. So, if you have a piece of land with planning permission and would like us to build your home, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p>

<p>Harvey Homes are also always looking for quality pieces of land, preferably with outline planning permission in good areas of North Wales and Wirral.</p>
